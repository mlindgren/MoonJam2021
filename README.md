## About
moon2GOLF is minigolf with a twist: there are obstacles that can destroy your ball. In God Gamer Mode, this means you'll have to start over from the first hole. If you're not a _real_ God Gamer, you can try Hardstuck Plat mode instead, where failure just means starting the current hole over.
