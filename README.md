## Building
The game builds with Godot 3.3. In theory, it should work on any platform, but so far it has only been tested on Windows.

## About
moon2GOLF is minigolf with a twist: there are obstacles that can destroy your ball. In God Gamer Mode, this means you'll have to start over from the first hole. If you're not a _real_ God Gamer, you can try Hardstuck Plat mode instead, where failure just means starting the current hole over.

Created in 72 hours for the third anual [Moonmoon Game Jam](https://jam.moon2.tv/).

## Known issues
 - The ball will sometimes bounce off of the course walls at incorrect angles. This is due to a Godot 2D physics bug. See [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/32138) and [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/28438) for more information.
 - Ball texture doesn't animate correctly when the ball is rotated 90 degrees.
